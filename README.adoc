== To build and test

The build, test and release pipeline is specified in the the link:.gitlab-ci.yml[GitLab CI] config file.
This pipeline or its stages can be run by GitLab.com CI as well as by a self-hosted GitLab instance.
This is elaborated in the https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/[GitLab CI docs].
In addition, the build and test stages can be run be run locally within a bare Docker container, without a GitLab CI pipeline.

NOTE: Please issue all of the following shell statements from within the root directory of this repository.

=== Without a GitLab CI pipeline

[source,sh]
----
sh build.sh --local --build

== Upgrading to a newer VLO version

The `copy_data.sh` script retrieves a VLO distribution package from GitHub on basis of a
fixed URL scheme that takes the VLO version as a parameter. To make this work for a new
release of the VLO, make sure the following has taken place:

. The target version of the VLO has been tagged with a tag of the from `vlo-${VERSION}`,
and this tag has been pushed to GitHub
** for examples see the https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO/tags[existing tags]
. A release has been made on basis of this tag 
** see
https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO/releases)[existing releases] and the
https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/[GitHub documentation on releases]
. A docker specific build of the VLO has been created (using `mvn package -Pdocker`) and
its distribution package (the output of the `vlo-distribution` subproject) has been
attached to the release
** this should result in there being a distribution package 
available (publicly) at the URL
`https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO/releases/download/vlo-${VERSION}/vlo-${VERSION}-docker.tar.gz`
** see the https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO/blob/master/README.md[VLO documentation] for
more information on building the VLO

Given these conditions, the only required change in this project is to set the 
`VLO_VERSION` variable in `copy_data.sh` to the target version.

== Parameters

These are to be passed as environment variables. The `VloConfig.xml` file and other configuration files get filtered (i.e. placeholder substitution takes place) using these on container startup and/or import (see the `filter-vlo-config.sh`, `init.sh` and `importer.sh` scripts).

[options="header",cols=",,,,"]
|===
| Name | Required | Type | Default value | Description

| VLO_DOCKER_CONFIG_FILE
| Yes
| String
| `/opt/vlo/config/VloConfig.xml`
| Location (within container) of the VLO configuration file

| VLO_MAPPING_DEFINITIONS_DIST_URL
| No
| String
| `https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO-mapping/archive/master.tar.gz`
| Specify the location of the tarball from which VLO mapping definitions are retrieved on startup and before import (leave empty to skip retrieval, e.g. when using a remote location - see `VLO_DOCKER_MAPPING_BASE_URI` parameter)

| VLO_MAPPING_DEFINITIONS_DIR
| Yes
| String
| `/srv/VLO-mapping`
| Path within container where VLO mapping files are read from and/or retrieved to

|===

Parameters that are used to filter `VloConfig.xml`:

[options="header",cols=",,,,"]
|===
| Name | Required | Type | Default value | Description

| VLO_DOCKER_SOLR_URL
| Yes
| String
|
| base URL for the Solr instance to be used by the importer and web app for connecting.
- for example: `http://vlo_solr:8983/solr/vlo-index/` (trailing slash required!)

| VLO_DOCKER_PUBLIC_HOME_URL
| Yes
| String
| `http://localhost:8080`
| public base URL of the web application. 
- for example: `http://beta-vlo.clarin.eu`

| VLO_DOCKER_MAPPING_BASE_URI
| Yes
| String
| `file:/srv/VLO-mapping/`
| base URL (file or http) for retrieval of the VLO mapping files

| VLO_DOCKER_FILE_PROCESSING_THREADS
| Yes
| Integer
| `-1`
| number of file processing threads (number of CPU cores seems to be a good rule of thumb, or use -1 to let the VM decide based on the available number of cores)

| VLO_DOCKER_SOLR_THREADS
| Yes
| Integer
| `2`
| number of Solr threads (0.5 to 1.0 times the number of file processing threads seems to be a good rule of thumb)

| VLO_DOCKER_DELETE_ALL_FIRST
| Yes
| Boolean
| `false`
| a boolean determining whether the index should be cleaned at the start of import

| VLO_DOCKER_MAX_DAYS_IN_SOLR
| Yes
| Integer
| `7`
| number of days after which files that have disappeared should be removed from the index

| VLO_DOCKER_DATAROOTS_FILE
| Yes
| String
| `dataroots-production.xml`
| filename (absolute or relative to `VloConfig.xml`) that defines the data roots; this can be one of the shipped data root definitions or your own custom definition from a volume or mount
- for example: `dataroots-production.xml`
- or: `/srv/myconfig/dataroots.xml`
